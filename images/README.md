# Image Placeholders

This directory should contain the following images for the portfolio website:

## Required Images

1. **profile-icon.jpg**
   - Small profile icon displayed in the header
   - Recommended size: 50x50 pixels
   - Currently referenced in: `index.html` (header section)

2. **banner-image.jpg**
   - Image displayed in the banner section
   - Recommended size: 150x150 pixels
   - Currently referenced in: `index.html` (banner section)

3. **profile-photo.jpg**
   - Larger profile photo displayed in the about section
   - Recommended size: 300x300 pixels
   - Currently referenced in: `index.html` (about section)

## How to Add Images

1. Place the image files in this directory
2. Make sure the filenames match exactly as listed above
3. If you want to use different filenames, update the references in `index.html`

## Temporary Solution

Until you add your own images, you can use placeholder services like:

- [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/)
- [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos/)

Example usage in HTML:
```html
<!-- For profile icon -->
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/50" alt="Leah Wilson-Duff" class="profile-icon">

<!-- For banner image -->
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Leah at computer" class="banner-image">

<!-- For profile photo -->
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300" alt="Leah Wilson-Duff" class="profile-photo">
```

You can update the `index.html` file to use these placeholder URLs temporarily.
